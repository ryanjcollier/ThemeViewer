If you would like to use the included theme in your own application you must copy the following directories and their files to your resources directory:

Optionally, if you wish to custom compile this theme or make changes to it, copy the following directy as well:

KNOWN "THEME" ISSUES
------------
* Need to update included "holiday" theme to fix modal dialog titles, and tolbar button texts. (Currently doesn't have enough contrast to background, but works.)

* Minor polish to included "holiday" theme.

ENJOY!
